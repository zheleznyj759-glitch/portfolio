# <img src="../assets/logo.png"> Tutorial 1 – Setting Up the Project

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - for managing JavaScript packages.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - for cloning the repository and version control.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ryanbalieiro/react-portfolio-template
```

2. Go to the project's root folder and use npm to install all required components:
```
npm install
```

3. Launch the project in developer mode:
```
npm run dev
```

4. Run the command below to clear out the default content:
```
npm run resume:clear
```
This will reset your portfolio, removing all the pre-filled sections and content—giving you a clean slate to start from.
